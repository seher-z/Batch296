        Object data type is the FATHER of all data types => Adam is to humans, Object is to data types
        General rule: To store the result in its relevant data type
        BUt is some cases, when we have to deal with different data types, it's an option to use Object data type.
        Remember OBJECT data type uses HUGE memory. USE IT ONLY WHEN YOU REALLLLLLLY NEED IT.

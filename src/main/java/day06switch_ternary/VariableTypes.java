          1. Local Variable:  is created within a method body {} and can be used only  in the same {} => limited in scope
          2. Class / Instance Variable: is created at the class level and can be reached out at any point within the SAME Class
          3. Static Variable: has 'static' keyword, and it has the widest scope => it's available across packages

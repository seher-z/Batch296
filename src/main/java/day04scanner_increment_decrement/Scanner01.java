        How many JAVA LIBRARIES we have used so far?

        java.util => all utility classes come from this library => Scanner, Arrays, Collections etc.
        java.lang => System, String, Object
        java.sql => Connection, Statement etc. => all database related operations
        java.io => used for File related operations

        There are 3rd party external libraries as well:
        Apache Maven
        JavaFx
        Hibernate
        Selenium

        when nextLine() is used after NUMERIC inputs, it creates a problem.
        Because it has a hidden '\n' value. It stops the data flow and because of next line character,
        it jumps to the next line straight away.

        How can we solve this issue?
        1) Don't use it after numeric inputs. Use next() instead.
        2) If you must use nextLine() to store some data, use an empty nextLine() before.
           This will take care of the hidden '\n' and your normal nextLine() method will work as expected.

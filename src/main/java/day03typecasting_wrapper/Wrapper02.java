        Primitive data type => byte < short < int < long < float < double

        Primitive data type allows to store values only. They don't have methods.
        In order to do any data manipulation, we need methods.
        This problem was resolved by creating WRAPPER classes for all Primitive data types.

        byte => Byte
        short => Short
        int => Integer
        long => Long
        float => Float
        double => Double
        char => Character
        boolean => Boolean

        WRAPPER  classes provide values as well as methods.

        Wrapper classes ARE Non-Primitive data types.

        When we convert Primitive data types in to their Wrapper classes, it's called "Auto-boxing".
        Java performs this function automatically.

        When we convert Wrapper classes to their Primitive data types, it's called "Un-boxing".
        Java performs this function automatically.

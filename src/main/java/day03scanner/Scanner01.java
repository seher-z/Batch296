        ***** Scanner Class ******
        - Scanner class is used to get the input (values) from the user
        - Why do we need it?
        - Every application needs to interact with the users and need their credentials/PIN to allow them into their accounts.
          (ATM, Banking, E-commerce, School accounts, Calculators)
        - User inputs (provides) their data (values) and that goes into the application database.
        - Once verified, the app allows the user to use the app.



       - How do we get the data from the user?
         Step 1: Create an object from Scanner class.
                 Type Scanner word, it will be red. Hover over it, it will show java.util, select that option
                 Scanner class will be imported from java.util library

                 Scanner Object
                 ClassName    objectName     Assignment Operator   'new'   keyword Constructor (with parameters)

        Step 2: Give a message to the user about the data / input that you want to get
        Step 3: Store the data provided by the user

           Scanner         input           =                   new       Scanner(System.in)                        ;
